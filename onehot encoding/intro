One approach to solve this problem can be label encoding where we will assign a numerical value to these labels for example Male and Female mapped to 0 and 1. But this can add bias in our model as it will start giving higher preference to the Female parameter as 1>0 but ideally, both labels are equally important in the dataset. To deal with this issue we will use the One Hot Encoding technique.
